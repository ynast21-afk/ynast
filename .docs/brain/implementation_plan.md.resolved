# Header Layout and Link Fixes

## Goal
1. Fix the layout overlap where the fixed header (including sub-nav) covers the top of video content.
2. Link the "Tags" button in the sub-header to the correct `/tags` page.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component] [Header](file:///C:/Users/user/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/streamvault/src/components/Header.tsx)
- Change `fixed` to `sticky` where appropriate, or wrap in a container to ensure it takes up space in the document flow.
- Update "Tags" link from `/coming-soon` to `/tags`.

### [Page] [Home Page](file:///C:/Users/user/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/streamvault/src/app/page.tsx)
- Adjust or remove the hardcoded spacer if the Header is changed to `sticky`.

### [Page] [Other Pages]
- Check `videos/page.tsx`, [actors/page.tsx](file:///C:/Users/user/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/streamvault/src/app/actors/page.tsx), etc., for similar overlap issues.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- N/A

### Manual Verification
1. Open the home page and verify the header does not overlap the video content.
2. Click the "Tags" button in the sub-header and verify it navigates to the Tags page.
3. Check mobile view to ensure no regressions.
